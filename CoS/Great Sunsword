	description : "As a bonus action, I can have this hilt create a blade of radiance. It acts like a greatsword with +2 to hit and damage, does radiant damage (+1d8 to undead), has finesse, emits bright sunlight in a 30-ft radius and dim light in another 30 ft. As an action, I can change the light's radius by 5 ft. It is sentient, see Notes page.",
	descriptionLong : "As a bonus action, I can have this longsword hilt create or dismiss a blade of pure radiance. While the blade exists, it acts like a greatsword that has +2 to attack and damage rolls, does radiant damage, and has the finesse property. It deals +1d8 damage to undead and emits sunlight, bright light in a 30-ft radius and dim light in an additional 30-ft radius. As an action, I can expand or reduce both the bright and dim light's radius by 5 ft each, to a maximum of 60 ft each or a minimum of 15 ft each. I'm proficient with it if I'm proficient with either geatswords or longsword. It is sentient, see Notes page.",
	descriptionFull : "The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel.\n   Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.\n   The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade.\n   While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the sun blade.\n   You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.\n   The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.\n   " + toUni("Sentience") + ". The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.

The Sunsword's special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade.
