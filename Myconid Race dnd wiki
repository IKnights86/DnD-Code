The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Constitution modifier or be stunned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You regain use of this trait once you have completed a short or long rest.",
		"Rapport Spores: You may as an action, extend rapport spores in a 20-foot radius. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.",
		"Animating Spores: As an action, you can target one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant(MM p.231). The corpse stays animated for 1d4 + 1 days or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way. You can only have one spore servant at a time. You regain spent use of this trait when you complete a long rest."
