		subname : "Path of the Elements", //required; the name of the subclass

		source : ["LotL", 19], //required; the source and the page number. "HB" stands for homebrew. See the "Complete SourceList" for an overview of sources that are already defined. Or define a new source using the "Homebrew Syntax - SourceList.js". // This can be an array of arrays to indicate the things appears in multiple sources. For example, if something appears on page 7 of the Elemental Evil Player's Companion and on page 115 of the Sword Coast Adventure Guide, use the following: [["E", 7], ["S", 115]]

		// after defining the above three, you don't need to define anything more, but you can. Defining more stuff will overwrite the entries as they are given in the ClassList. So if you do not need something to be different than the basics of the class (for example, you subclass uses the same spellcasting ability), then you don't need to define it again.
		// For the syntax of how to define more stuff, look at the ClassList (see "Homebrew Syntax - ClassList.js"). You can define all the same stuff in the same way. The below are a couple of examples:

		fullname : "Path of the Elements", //if no fullname is defined it will be automatically generated as "Class Name (Subclass name)". In this example that would be: "MyClass (Path of SpecialMe)"

		features : { //unlike the other entries, "features" will not delete all the features from the ClassList, but will add to the features in the ClassList. For this to work properly, the feature object has to be named "subclassfeatureX" and not something appropriate for the feature. The below are the features of the purple Dragon Knight

			"subclassfeature3" : { // has to start with "subclassfeature" followed by a number. Note that the name has to be unique for this subclass, but it can be the same name as one of the features of the class in the ClassList variable. If you use the same name as a feature in the ClassList variable, it will be overwritten with this entry
